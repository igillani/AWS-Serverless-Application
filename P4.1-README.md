# P4.1 - Serverless User Management with AWS Lambda and API Gateway

## Overview
This project demonstrates a serverless architecture for user management using AWS services. It includes a backend powered by AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway, and a frontend hosted on S3 for user interaction.

---

## Architecture
### Components:
1. **Backend**:
   - **AWS Lambda**:
     - Handles API operations: `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE`.
   - **Amazon DynamoDB**:
     - Stores user data with `user_id` as the primary key.
   - **API Gateway**:
     - Exposes RESTful endpoints to interact with Lambda.

2. **Frontend**:
   - A simple HTML/JavaScript-based UI.
   - Hosted on S3 with static website hosting enabled.

---

## API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint                      | Description            |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| GET    | `/users`                      | Fetch all users        |
| POST   | `/users`                      | Add a new user         |
| DELETE | `/users?user_id={user_id}`    | Delete a user by ID    |

### Example Payloads
#### POST (Add User):
```json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### DELETE (Delete User):
```plaintext
/users?user_id=123
```

---

## Frontend Functionality
The frontend provides a simple interface for:
- Adding a user (via a form).
- Fetching the list of users.
- Deleting a user by `user_id`.

---

## Setup Instructions
### Backend
1. **Lambda Function**:
   - Deploy the provided `lambda_function.py` to AWS Lambda.
   - Use Python 3.x as the runtime.
   - Attach the `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` and `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` policies to the execution role.
2. **DynamoDB Table**:
   - Create a table named `serverless_users`.
   - Set `user_id` as the partition key (type: String).
3. **API Gateway**:
   - Expose `/users` resource with methods `GET`, `POST`, and `DELETE`.
   - Integrate each method with the Lambda function.
   - Enable **CORS** for all methods.

### Frontend
1. **Static Website Hosting**:
   - Upload `index.html` to an S3 bucket.
   - Enable static website hosting on the bucket.
   - Set `index.html` as the root document.
2. **Bucket Policy**:
   - Add a bucket policy to allow public read access:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Action": "s3:GetObject",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

---

## Testing
### Test API Endpoints
Use tools like `curl` or Postman:
1. **GET**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://<API-ID>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/users"
   ```
2. **POST**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://<API-ID>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/users" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -d '{"user_id": "123", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john.doe@example.com"}'
   ```
3. **DELETE**:
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE "https://<API-ID>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/users?user_id=123"
   ```

### Test the Frontend
1. Open the **S3 bucket's static website hosting URL** in your browser.
2. Use the provided interface to:
   - Add users.
   - Fetch users.
   - Delete users.
3. Monitor the **DynamoDB Console** to verify updates.

### Cloudformation Template

## Infrastructure as Code

This project includes a CloudFormation template (`cloudformation/p4-1-serverless.yml`) to provision the resources required for the application. The template creates:
- A DynamoDB table for storing user data.
- A Lambda function for handling user management operations.
- An API Gateway for exposing REST endpoints.
- An S3 bucket for hosting the frontend.

To deploy the stack:
1. Open the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **CloudFormation** â†’ **Create Stack**.
3. Upload the `p4-1-serverless.yml` file and follow the steps.


---

## Challenges and Lessons Learned
- Debugging **CORS** issues required careful configuration of API Gateway and static website hosting.
- Integration between frontend and backend services was achieved successfully.

---

## Next Steps
- Add validation to the frontend forms.
- Implement pagination for the user list.
- Extend functionality to include `PUT` for updating users.
